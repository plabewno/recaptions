Create a fully functional, modern frontend UI for the @src and @transcriber.mjs Remotion app.
I have set up a React, Rsbuild, and Tailwind CSS project in the @ui folder.

The UI should include the following features:
- Upload an input video directly through the frontend UI.
- Transcription, preview, and rendering from the frontend UI.
- Download the rendered video directly in the user's browser.
- A user-friendly, modern toolkit for customizing captions.
- Hono.js for the backend server.
